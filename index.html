    <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
    <h2 id="harrisongram">harrisongram</h2>
    <p>I had a lot of fun making an Instagram clone called <em>harrisongram</em>. I made an android app in app inventor to talk to the server on google app engine. I learned how to authenticate the different users. I also learned how to store images in a database and serve them to users.</p>
